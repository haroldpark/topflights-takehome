## Notes from Harold

### Further improvements to be made:
- adding a proper types file for Typescript
- styling
- more animations
- refactoring components to be smaller
- add more nice ux functionalities like toasts, breadcrumbs, etc
- testing
- documentation of the code and the workflow of app
- adding different images for products

### I wasn't clear on:
- How to access the storefront pages vs provider-portal pages. In reality, I would imagine after providers login, they would be able to access their portal pages through RBAC.

### Bonus functionalities implemented
- ability to add pictures for products
- data persistence in cart and orders
- deployment
